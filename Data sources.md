# Ordo · Real-time industrial data sources

Researched and checked against vendor pages on 2 October 2026. Prices and availability change, so confirm with each provider before you commit.
**RT** = real-time stream · **NRT** = near-real-time · **Batch** = periodic or file download.

Only the MTConnect demo agent was confirmed serving live data during this research (OKUMA and Mazak streams, timestamped 1 Oct 2026). The OPC UA and MQTT endpoints are listed by their vendors or community registries; uptime is not guaranteed.

## How these map to Ordo's architecture

| Ordo layer | Use |
|---|---|
| L1 Shop floor (no factory yet) | Public demo servers, simulators, replayed datasets (sections 1–2) |
| L2 Edge gateway | HiveMQ Edge, Litmus Edge, Kepware, Ignition, HighByte (section 3) |
| L3 Data platform | MQTT broker, Kafka, time-series DB, cloud IoT services (section 4) |
| Planning & Supply agents | Metals, energy, freight, supplier-risk and macro feeds (section 5) |
