# Pipeline template library

Ordo ships 15 templates. Parallel stages share a column and are joined with **+**; numbers follow the console (`02a`, `02b` for parallel lanes). The summary table lists each rework loop (where a later stage sends units back to an earlier one). Gates are stages owned by the Vision QA agent (default execution mode *Approve*).

## Discrete assembly

*Discrete.* Order-driven build of multi-part products: sourcing and tooling run in parallel, a vision gate before packing, and a rework loop back to sub-assembly.

**Flow:** Order intake → Material sourcing + Tooling prep → Machining + Fixture build → Sub-assembly → Final assembly + Documentation pack → Quality inspection → Packaging → Dispatch  
**Rework loop:** stage 06 sends units back to stage 04.
