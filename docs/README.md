# Ordo documentation

Markdown versions of the Ordo product, architecture and validation documentation. Edit these files directly; diagrams are written in [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) and render on GitHub.

The original designed versions are kept alongside: [`Ordo Documentation.dc.html`](../Ordo%20Documentation.dc.html) (printable) and [`Ordo Architecture.dc.html`](../Ordo%20Architecture.dc.html) (diagram). If you change behaviour here, update the prototype or note the difference.
