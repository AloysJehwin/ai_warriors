# Research behind the lab pitch

Related work for presenting Ordo as the verification layer of an autonomous lab: a protein-synthesis lab that runs itself, with scientists who sign off what it produces. Use it for the submission, the README and the pitch deck. Collected 22 October 2026.

Contents: the pitch in one paragraph, then the papers in three groups (autonomous labs exist, their results need verifying, and the case for tamper-evident research records), then how Ordo maps onto a lab, and what to check before quoting.

## The pitch in one paragraph

AI-run labs such as SAMPLE and Coscientist already design and run experiments without people. A-Lab showed that their results still need accountable experts to check them, and more than 70% of scientists say they have failed to reproduce someone else's experiment. Ordo makes every result signed by a verified human scientist, anchored on-chain, and paid for only when it is proven.

## Before quoting

- **A-Lab numbers.** The counts above come from news coverage and a correction tracker, and they differ between sources (40-plus, 41, 43 new materials originally; 36 of 57 after correction). Check the Nature correction notice before putting a number on a slide.
- **Blockchain-for-research papers** are mostly proofs of concept and commentary. Say "researchers have proposed", not "this is proven".
- **Compliance.** Ordo's EIP-712 signatures are in the spirit of electronic-signature rules for regulated labs (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, GLP). Do not claim Ordo is compliant.
- **Simulated data.** Say the instrument data in the demo is simulated. Judges with a biology background will notice implausible units or yields.
- **Not yet read:** "LAP: An Agent-to-Instrument Protocol for Autonomous Science", [arXiv:2606.03755](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.03755). It looks relevant to the agent-to-instrument layer; read it before citing.
